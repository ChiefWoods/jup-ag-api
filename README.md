## Developing

This repository uses Bun. Install its dependencies with:

```bash
bun install
```

### OpenAPI generation

The version-controlled source specifications live under `openapi/`, preserving
their Jupiter product and version directory structure. `openapi/jupiter.yaml` is
the derived composite input consumed by the TypeScript generator. Upstream
specification updates are copied into this directory and reviewed here.

To add a new OpenAPI specification to the client:

1. Add the source YAML under `openapi/`, using its natural product/version path.
2. Run `bun run prepare-openapi`. It discovers every source YAML, derives its
   normalized tag from the path, and refreshes `openapi/jupiter.yaml`.
3. Add the corresponding service key and default URL to
   `clients/ts/config.ts`, then expose its generated API from
   `clients/ts/JupiterApi.ts` in the same nested structure as `openapi/`.
4. Run `bun run generate` to rebuild the composite specification and the typed
   client under `generated/ts`.
5. Run the validation commands below before committing the change.

Use these commands during development:

```bash
# Refresh only the composite root specification.
bun run prepare-openapi

bun run openapi-gen:ts

# Clean generated output, prepare the root, and generate the client.
bun run generate

# Apply lint fixes and verify formatting.
bun run lint
bun run format:check

# Regenerate and compile the published ESM, CJS, and declaration output.
bun run build
```

### Releases

Bump the version in `package.json`, then tag that version (`v6.0.49`, etc.) to
trigger trusted publication.
